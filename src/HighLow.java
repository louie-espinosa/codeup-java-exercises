//    Game picks a random number between 1 and 100.
//    Prompts user to guess the number.
//    All user inputs are validated.
//    If user's guess is less than the number, it outputs "HIGHER".
//    If user's guess is more than the number, it outputs "LOWER".
//    If a user guesses the number, the game should declare "GOOD GUESS!"
